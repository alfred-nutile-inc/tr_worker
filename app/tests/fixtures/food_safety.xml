				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fairway “Like No Other Market” of New York, NY, is <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm435547.htm">recalling</a> Fairway brand Raw Hazelnuts (Filberts) because the product has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. The Fairway brand Raw Hazelnuts (Filberts) were distributed to Fairway stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and also through home delivery programs provided by Google and Instacart.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2015/02/Fairway-filbert-label.jpg"><img class="hello" style="display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;"class="alignright size-full wp-image-108100" src="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2015/02/Fairway-filbert-label.jpg" alt="Fairway filbert label" width="406" height="541" /></a>The product is packaged in clear, plastic cello bags of varying weights, each weighing less than one pound. The product bears Item Code 228119. All “SELL BY” Date codes of May 15, 2015, and earlier are being recalled.</p>
<p>There have been no reported illnesses to date.</p>
<p>The recall is the result of a routine sampling program by FDA, which revealed that the finished product contained the bacteria. The company has ceased distribution of the Fairway brand Raw Hazelnut (Filberts) and removed the product from Fairway store shelves while FDA and the company continue their investigation into what caused the problem.</p>
<p>Consumers who purchased the Fairway brand Raw Hazelnuts (Filberts) should return the product to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at (855) 856-9566, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>Salmonella can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses, such as arterial infections (e.g., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Kenosha Beef International of Columbus, OH, is recalling approximately 21,427 pounds of ready-to-eat beefsteak patty product that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). The fully cooked beefsteak patties were produced on Jan. 24, 2015. The following product is subject to recall: 35.3-lb. boxes of “Fully... <a class="more" href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2015/02/beefsteak-patties-for-restaurants-recalled-for-listeria-risk/">Continue Reading</a>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2015/02/beefsteak-patties-406.jpg"><img class="hello" style="display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;"class="alignright size-full wp-image-107971" src="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2015/02/beefsteak-patties-406.jpg" alt="http://www.dreamstime.com/stock-photo-raw-meat-patties-plate-beef-hamburger-fresh-herbs-cooking-image33223590" width="406" height="250" /></a>Kenosha Beef International of Columbus, OH, is recalling approximately 21,427 pounds of ready-to-eat beefsteak patty product that may be contaminated with <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>, <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2015/recall-034-2015-release">according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)</a>.</p>
<p>The fully cooked beefsteak patties were produced on Jan. 24, 2015. The following product is subject to recall:</p>
<ul>
<li>35.3-lb. boxes of “Fully Cooked Black Angus Ground Beefsteak (chopped and formed)” with product number 87657 and “use thru” date of 01/24/16.</li>
</ul>
<p>The product bears the establishment number “EST. 10130” inside the USDA mark of inspection. This product was shipped to distributors in Illinois and North Carolina for further distribution to restaurants.</p>
<p>The problem was discovered by a customer of Kenosha Beef International. The customer, a further processor, tested a sample of product produced the same day as the recalled product, returning a positive result for <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>.</p>
<p>No illnesses have been reported in connection with this product. However, due to the time required to trace a foodborne illness back to a specific food product, it is impossible to say whether or not any illnesses have occurred.</p>
<p>Consumption of food contaminated with <em>Listeria </em>can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.</p>
<p>Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn.</p>
<p>Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.</p>
<p>FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their<strong> </strong>customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.</p>
<p>FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jesse “Babe” Amaral Jr., former co-owner of the Petaluma, CA, slaughterhouse previously known as Rancho Feeding Corporation, has joined three other defendants in pleading guilty to conspiracy to distribute adulterated, misbranded, and uninspected meat.</p>
<p>All four defendants will proceed to status hearings and sentencing later this year as there is now no need for any trials over charges involving diseased cattle reaching the human food market and causing a year&#8217;s worth of beef production to be <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2014/02/retailer-list-in-9-million-pound-beef-recall-expands/#.VOYoeLDF_uw">recalled</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2013/03/feedlot_406x250.jpg"><img class="hello" style="display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;"class="alignright size-full wp-image-66352" title="feedlot_406x250" src="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2013/03/feedlot_406x250.jpg" alt="" width="406" height="250" /></a>The plea was entered with U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California after Amaral reached an agreement with government attorneys. It was announced by U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag and Lori Chan, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Office of Inspector General for the western region.</p>
<p>The plea agreement remains a sealed court document, but Haag’s office says that Amaral, 77, admitted that from 2012 through Jan. 10, 2014, he knowingly and with intent to defraud directed Rancho employees to process for human consumption cattle that had been condemned by the USDA veterinarian, to circumvent inspection procedures for certain cattle exhibiting symptoms of cancer eye, and to process these cancer eye cattle for human consumption without full inspection.</p>
<p>Amaral further admitted knowingly causing Rancho to submit fraudulent cattle invoices to farmers between at least 2012 and January 2014. He was <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2014/08/rancho-feedings-babe-amaral-charged-with-11-federal-felonies/#.VOYnsrDF_uw">indicted</a> on Aug. 14, 2014, along with Rancho employees Eugene Corda, 66, and Felix Cabrera, 56.</p>
<p>All three men were charged with distribution of adulterated, misbranded, and uninspected meat in violation of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), 21 U.S.C. §§ 610(c) &amp; 676(a); conspiracy to commit the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and mail fraud conspiracy in furtherance of the same scheme, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349.</p>
<p>Amaral was also charged with mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and mail fraud conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349, in a separate scheme to defraud farmers by means of false invoicing.</p>
<p>Robert Singleton, 78, the owner of Petaluma-based Rancho Veal Corporation, was charged by Information on Aug. 18, 2014, with one count of distributing adulterated, misbranded, and uninspected meat in violation of the FMIA. He pleaded guilty on Aug. 22, 2014.</p>
<p>In so doing, Singleton admitted knowingly participating in a scheme by which Rancho employees were instructed to carve “USDA Condemned” stamps out of cattle carcasses, to conceal from USDA inspection cows showing signs of cancer eye by switching the diseased heads with healthy heads, and to process the adulterated and uninspected carcasses for human consumption. He also admitted participating in the scheme to fraudulently invoice farmers.</p>
<p>Cabrera, Rancho’s “kill floor” supervisor, pleaded guilty on Nov. 26, 2014, to conspiracy to distribute adulterated, misbranded, and uninspected meat. <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2014/10/government-settles-with-rancho-yardman/#.VOYngLDF_uw">Corda</a>, Rancho’s yardman, pleaded guilty to the same offense on Oct. 10, 2014.</p>
<p>Amaral’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 1, 2015, before U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer. A status hearing is scheduled for Singleton, Cabrera, and Corda on Aug. 12, 2015, also before Judge Breyer.</p>
<p>The maximum statutory penalties for conspiracy to distribute adulterated meat are 5 years imprisonment, 3 years supervised release, a $250,000 fine, and a $100 special assessment. The maximum statutory penalties for fraudulent distribution of adulterated meat are 3 years imprisonment, 1 year supervised release, a $10,000 fine, and a $100 special assessment. The maximum statutory penalties for mail fraud and mail fraud conspiracy are 20 years imprisonment, 3 years supervised release, a $250,000 fine, and a $100 special assessment.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these statutory maximums, any sentence imposed by the court following conviction would take into consideration the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.</p>
<p>Hartley M.K. West is the Assistant U.S. Attorney prosecuting this case, with the assistance of Rosario Calderon. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by agents of the USDA’s Office of Inspector General, Office of Investigations, and USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service, Office of Investigation, Enforcement and Audit, Compliance and Investigations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to the growing list of recalled food products containing ground cumin or cumin powder that may contain undeclared peanut protein, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is advising people who are highly allergic to peanuts to consider avoiding such products.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2015/02/Cumin-ground-and-seeds.jpg"><img class="hello" style="display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;"class="alignright size-full wp-image-107818" title="http://www.dreamstime.com/stock-images-ground-cumin-wooden-spoon-whole-image41744984" src="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2015/02/Cumin-ground-and-seeds.jpg" alt="" width="406" height="277" /></a>In a <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/SafetyAlertsAdvisories/ucm434274.htm">consumer advice page</a> posted Wednesday afternoon, the agency noted that &#8220;some shipments of these products have tested positive for undeclared peanut protein.&#8221;</p>
<p>FDA further stated that the ground cumin may be sold as a spice, in a spice mix or kit, or as a minor ingredient when used in finished food products such as soups and chilies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most finished products are expected to have low amounts of ground cumin, and therefore low amounts of peanut protein. Products made before 2014 are unlikely to contain the affected ground cumin,&#8221; the site stated.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the page, FDA posted a partial list of recalled products containing cumin and may contain undeclared peanut protein. Additional recalls involving meat and poultry products containing cumin and may contain undeclared peanut protein have been announced by USDA&#8217;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and can be found <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/current-recalls-and-alerts">here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The FDA is continuing to identify companies that received shipments of the ground cumin that contained undeclared peanuts and work with them to remove these products from the market. While this investigation is underway, the FDA wants consumers who are highly allergic or sensitive to peanuts to consider taking precautions with any product—not just those that have been recalled—that contains ground cumin. The FDA will continue to update the list of recalled products,&#8221; the agency stated.</p>
<p>FDA suggested that consumers with severe peanut allergies and their caregivers should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the list of recalled products and avoid these foods. They include ground cumin, seasoning mixes, and a variety of cooking “kits” which include “Tex-Mex” and Indian dishes.</li>
<li>When choosing a food, review the ingredients panel. Products such as soups or chilies that contain only small amounts of the affected ground cumin may not contain enough peanut protein to trigger a reaction in most peanut-allergic people. However, people who are highly sensitive to peanuts may consider avoiding products that list “cumin.”</li>
<li>Realize that if the ingredients panel lists “spices,” it may or may not contain ground cumin. People who are highly sensitive to peanuts may want to call the manufacturer to find out if the product contains cumin powder.</li>
<li>If symptoms of an allergic reaction occur, such as shortness of breath, swelling of the lips, tongue or throat, or hives, stop eating the product and seek immediate medical care or advice.</li>
<li>If an allergic reaction occurs, you can contact your local FDA consumer complaint coordinator. Go <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/ReportaProblem/ConsumerComplaintCoordinators/default.htm">here</a> to find yours.</li>
</ul>
<p>In response to FDA&#8217;s consumer advisory, McCormick &amp; Company Inc. released a <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mccormick-products-not-involved-in-recent-peanut-contamination-of-cumin-300038446.html">statement</a> Thursday noting that none of the company&#8217;s products are involved in the recent recalls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Due to the FDA Consumer Advisory and increased attention surrounding peanut contamination of cumin in the marketplace, we want to assure the public that <strong>no McCormick products are involved.</strong> This includes all ground cumin, cumin seed, and seasonings that contain cumin like Taco Seasoning Mix and Chili Powder,&#8221; said Roger Lawrence, McCormick&#8217;s corporate vice president of global quality assurance.</p>
<p>The statement further noted that McCormick only uses whole cumin seed, does not handle any peanut materials in facilities where its cumin seeds are cleaned and ground, treats its spices with a steaming process and inspects every lot for &#8220;extraneous matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without the benefit of full inspection, a possibility of adverse health consequences exists.</p>
<div>
<p>The boneless beef products were imported from Japan on various dates between Oct. 9, 2014 and Jan. 15, 2015, and labeled in Japanese only.</p>
<p>The following products are subject to recall:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Various weights and cuts of vacuum-packed chilled boneless beef.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vacuum packaging bears the Japanese translation for the following cuts:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Tender loin</li>
<li>Strip loin</li>
<li>Ribeye</li>
<li>Chuck Roll</li>
<li>Top Sirloin Butt</li>
<li>Chuck Ribs</li>
<li>Bottom Round</li>
<li>Top Round</li>
<li>Clod</li>
<li>Brisket</li>
<li>Short Plate</li>
<li>Short Rib</li>
<li>Knuckle</li>
</ul>
<p>The above products would have been shipped either inside of a cardboard box with the Japanese establishment number “M2” and a box marking of “MZA-TN41”, “MZA-TN28” or “MZA-TN1” or inside of a Styrofoam box bearing the establishment number “EST. 27510” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were shipped to distributors and retail locations in Arizona, California, and Washington.</p>
<p>The problem was discovered during routine review of product tracking records.</p>

<p>The recalled product is packaged in clear plastic bags with Natural Grocers label notating Julian pack on dates and pricing per pound. The product was produced in size ranges of 0.25 pound to 0.30 pound. The lots being recalled are identified by Julian packed on date and include: 351-14 and 006-15</p>
<p>The product was distributed to Natural Grocers’ 92 stores located in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

<p>Healthy persons infected with <em>Salmonella</em> often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with <em>Salmonella</em> can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (e.g., infected aneurysms) endocarditic and arthritis.</p>

The product was sold by Gold State Nut Company of Biggs, CA, and packaged by the Hines Nut Company.</p>
<p>The product was packaged and distributed as follows:</p>
<p>HINES NUT BRAND</p>
<ul>
<li>Packed in black foam trays with a Green and Gold Label</li>
<li>Weight of 12 or 16 ounces</li>
<li>Packaged between Nov. 25 and Dec. 5, 2014</li>
<li>Lot Number printed on label</li>
<li>Distributed in Texas</li>
<li>Best by dates from Sept. 21, 2015, to Oct. 1, 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>HARRIS TEETER FARMERS MARKET BRAND</p>
<ul>
<li>Packed in black foam trays with a Red and Black label</li>
<li>Weight of 10 ounces</li>
<li>Packaged Dec. 2, 2014</li>
<li>Lot number printed on Nutrition Facts label on back of package</li>
<li>Distributed to two distribution centers in North Carolina</li>
<li>Best-by date of Sept. 28, 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>The potential for contamination was noted after routine testing by an outside company contracted by FDA revealed the presence of Salmonella in a package of the product.</p>
<p>Consumers who have purchased any of the recalled products are urged not to eat them and to contact Hines Nut Company for information regarding a full refund or for disposal information.</p>
<p>Currently, Hines Nut Company has not received any complaints concerning illness on this lot number.</p>
<p>Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (e.g., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2014/11/RawChickenTrayFeatured.jpg"><img class="hello" style="display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;"class="size-full wp-image-102338 alignright" title="RawChickenTrayFeatured" src="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2014/11/RawChickenTrayFeatured.jpg" alt="" width="406" height="250" /></a>Without the benefit of full inspection, a possibility of adverse health consequences exists. The poultry items were produced on Feb. 2, 2015.</p>
<p>The following products are subject to recall:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>40-lb. bulk cases of “Sunrise Poultry CHICKEN THIGHS.”</li>

</ul>
<p>The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “Canada 591”. These products were shipped to retail locations in Washington.</p>
<p>The problem was discovered when the import facility reported to FSIS that product with an estimated date of arrival of Feb. 4, 2015, had not been received at that location.</p>
<p>FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Consumers with questions about the recall can contact Doreen Kerr at (604) 596-9505.</p>
<p>FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their<strong> </strong>customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls">www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls</a>.</p>

<p>Listeria is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, <em>Listeria </em>infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.</p>
